## Page structure

Follows the brief top to bottom: hero (headline, subheadline, primary CTA, app
badges, four story covers) → how it works in 3 steps → voice-narration feature
→ social proof strip → safety & screen-time block → FAQ → footer CTA banner →
footer.

The hero fills the viewport with its copy vertically centred. It is sized
`min-h-[calc(100svh-var(--nav-h))]`, **not** `100svh`: the navigation is sticky
and sits above the hero in flow, so a full `100svh` pushes the hero past the
fold by exactly the nav's height at every viewport. `--nav-h` is declared in
the base layer (65px, 81px from `lg`) beside the header that defines it.

`min-h` rather than `h`, so the hero still grows when the content is taller
than the space — below roughly 800px of viewport height the hero's own content
(~804px) exceeds the fold and the page scrolls, which is the right behaviour.
It fits exactly at 1440×900, 1512×982 and 1920×1080.

Its four covers carry the personalisation promise by showing it: two Western
tales and two Thai ones, spanning three categories. `StoryCover` puts the
caption below the artwork rather than over it — a gradient scrim would bury the
part of each scene that makes it recognisable — and each card sizes to its own
content, so a one-line title is not padded out to match a two-line neighbour.

Copy leads with the emotional hook and reaches the technology second, names
"free to start" in the hero, and answers the screen-time and privacy questions
explicitly rather than burying them.

## The squashed-SVG fix

The asset export ships **two copies of every decorative shape**. The
`svg-1xx`, `svg-2` and `svg-3` copies declare `width="100%" height="100%"` with
`preserveAspectRatio="none"` — no intrinsic ratio, so they stretch to fill
whatever box they land in. Each has a pixel-sized twin:

| Stretched | Correct twin | Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `svg-104` | `svg1148744201_643` | 231×244 |
| `svg-105` | `svg1461738047_385` | 140×116 |
| `svg-106` | `svg1267207472_4673` | 63×49 |
| `svg-107` | `svg1031543220_9253` | 100×103 |
| `svg-108` | `svg-1862830764_11036` | 119×122 |
| `svg-109` | `svg-695880022_913` | 171×174 |
| `svg-110` | `svg1358484439_910` | 149×143 |
| `svg-111` | `svg-1643664828_719` | 129×126 |
| `svg-112` | `svg285309579_906` | 138×138 |
| `svg-113` | `svg-1203999258_25150` | 101×68 |
| `svg-114` | `svg-202640766_9260` | 127×131 |
| `svg-115` | `svg-889674449_700` | 253×145 |
| `svg-2` | `svg-882616378_4701` | 62×49 |
| `svg-3` | `svg539152021_720` | 121×121 |

Only the twins are imported. On top of that, `src/lib/assets.js` exports a
`shapeRatios` map and `Decor` pins `aspect-ratio` from it, so a shape cannot be
squashed even if a caller sets an odd box. Source files were not modified.

The brand logo hit the same class of bug from a different direction: it is
4010×2127 **with no viewBox**, so leaving it to size itself rendered it 4010px
wide, and inside the footer's column flex container it stretched to the
container width. `Logo` pins `w-auto`, `self-start` and `object-contain`, so
the lockup holds its ratio wherever it is placed.

Verified: every `<img>` on the page renders within 2% of its intrinsic ratio.
The only two that differ are photographs using `object-fit: cover`, which crops
rather than distorts.

## Design tokens

Declared once in the `@theme` block of `src/index.css`; components consume the
generated utilities and never raw hex.

| Group | Tokens |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `--font-sans` (Inter, per the contract) |
| Body scale | `text-xs 12` · `sm 14` · `md 16` · `lg 18` · `xl 20` |
| Display scale | `d1 40` · `d2 32` · `d3 24` — documented extensions; the contract's scale stops at 20px, which no headline can use |
| Spacing | `s1 2` · `s2 8` · `s3 10` · `s4 12` · `s5 16` · `s6 20` · `s7 24` · `s8 26` |
| Radius | `xs 8` · `sm 10` · `md 20` · `lg 28` · `xl 36` · `full` |
| Elevation | `shadow-1/2/3` from the contract, plus `shadow-glow` — the contract's shadows are invisible on a black ground |
| Motion | `--motion-instant 150ms` · `--motion-fast 200ms` |

### Colour — and why this page is light, not dark

Straight from `lulladream.md`, converted from oklch:

| Contract token | Hex | Used as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text.primary` | `#0a0a0a` | headings and body |
| `text.secondary` | `#ffffff` | text on the purple CTA |
| `text.tertiary` | `#99a1af` | **non-text / decorative only** — 2.60:1 on white |
| `text.inverse` | `#131313` | dark text on tinted chips |
| `surface.muted` | `#595cff` | brand purple, all CTAs |
| `surface.raised` | `#ebeeff` | alternating section bands |
| `surface.strong` | `#e0e5ff` | pressed / hover panels |
| `border.default` | `#e5e5e5` | hairline borders |
| `surface.base` | `#000000` | night sky inside the story-cover art |

**`surface.base=#000000` is not the page background.** Reading it as one is
what produced an all-dark first draft, and it was wrong. The test that settles
it:

```
text.primary #0a0a0a  on  surface.base #000000   =  1.06:1   (invisible)
text.primary #0a0a0a  on  white                  = 19.80:1
```

No design system ships its primary text at 1.06:1 against its own base. Every
other token in the palette is unambiguously light — near-white `raised` and
`strong` surfaces, a `#e5e5e5` hairline border, near-black primary and inverse
text — and the brand logo sets "DREAM" in `#333333`, which disappears on a dark
ground. `text.secondary=#ffffff` is not evidence of a dark theme either: it is
the on-accent token, white on the purple button at 4.77:1. The source doc's own
extraction diagnostics flag low confidence on inferred context.

`#000000` is still used, where it genuinely belongs: the night sky inside the
illustrated story covers.

### Two deliberate deviations

1. **Focus ring.** The contract's `oklab(0.708 0 0 / 0.5)` is a 50% grey at
   2.6:1 on white. The ring is `dream-600`, which clears 3:1 on every surface
   (6.06 white / 5.25 raised / 4.85 strong), and flips to white on the purple
   band.
2. **`text-muted` (`#5f6675`).** `text.tertiary` fails AA for body copy, so it
   is reserved for decoration and `text-muted` is added as a documented step —
   the lightest grey still clearing 4.5:1 on all three light surfaces (5.76 /
   5.00 / 4.62).

Text on the purple CTA band is solid white throughout: translucent white drops
to 3.6:1 there, so hierarchy comes from size and weight instead of opacity.

## Component states

`Button` implements all seven required states — default, hover, focus-visible,
active, disabled, loading (`aria-busy` + spinner + SR text) and error. Cards,
links and FAQ rows define default, hover, focus-visible and active.

## Motion

Three pieces of the page move. All are decorative, all are frozen by
`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, and all are verified in test rather than
merely declared.

- **Rotating photo mask** (`Photo` with `spin`). The wrapper carries the
  clip-path and turns over 34s; the image counter-rotates at the same rate, so
  the silhouette appears to rotate around a photograph that stays upright. The
  image is scaled to 1.22 inside the mask so the counter-turn never exposes an
  empty corner.
- **Waveform** in the recording card. Each bar runs the same pulse on its own
  delay and duration, which reads as audio playing rather than a static chart.
- **Testimonial marquee.** The quotes render twice — the clones are
  `aria-hidden`, so each review is announced once — and the track translates
  −50%, which loops seamlessly because the gap sits on each item rather than on
  the flex container. It pauses on hover and whenever focus enters the strip
  (which is a tab stop), and freezes under reduced motion.

  **Open accessibility item:** the visible pause button was removed by request.
  **WCAG 2.2 SC 2.2.2 (Level A)** requires a mechanism to pause content that
  scrolls automatically for more than five seconds, and hover does not count —
  it is unreachable by keyboard and touch. Focus-within covers a keyboard user
  who happens to tab into the strip, but not one who never does, and not a
  touch user at all. Restoring the button, or making the scroll start only on
  interaction, would close this.

- **Mobile menu slide-down.** The sheet animates `grid-template-rows` from
  `0fr` to `1fr`, which is the one way to transition to a content-driven height
  without hard-coding one — the panel keeps working however the link list
  grows. Two details it depends on: the clipping wrapper must carry no padding
  of its own (padding is not collapsed by a zero-height row, so the closed
  panel would sit 40px tall), and the panel stays mounted, so `inert` is what
  keeps it out of the tab order and the accessibility tree while closed —
  `hidden` would kill the transition.

- **Scroll reveal** (`Reveal` + `src/lib/revealScheduler.js`). Blocks are masked
  off at the bottom edge and wiped upward with `clip-path`, eased
  `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` — fast out, long slow settle. The hero
  reveals on load with a stagger; everything below reveals on approach. It
  fires once and never re-hides.

  Two traps here, both worth knowing about.

  **The clip must be dropped once the wipe ends.** Leaving `clip-path:
  inset(0)` in place crops everything that legitimately overflows the box — the
  soft glows behind the photos, card shadows — into a hard-edged rectangle. The
  component clears it on `transitionend` (with a timer as a safety net), and a
  test asserts no revealed block keeps a clip-path.

  **IntersectionObserver cannot drive a clip-path reveal.** `inset(100% 0 0 0)` leaves zero visible area, so the observer
  reports `intersectionRatio: 0` and never fires — the element stays masked
  forever, and the content is simply never seen. The scheduler reads
  `getBoundingClientRect()` instead, which reports the layout box regardless of
  clipping, from one rAF-throttled listener shared by every pending element.
  Its threshold is "top edge above 90% of the viewport", so a fast scroll, an
  anchor jump or a restored scroll position cannot skip a block.

## Accessibility

Target **WCAG 2.2 AA**. axe-core at 1440px and 390px: **0 violations**.

- Skip link is the first tab stop and reveals on focus.
- FAQ is a native `<button>` inside an `<h3>` controlling a labelled `region`.
  Items open independently — a parent comparing privacy answers should not have
  one snap shut when they open the next.
- Every decorative element (starfield, shapes, glows) is `aria-hidden` and
  unfocusable; ornaments are hidden below `lg`, where they land on the copy.
- The testimonial marquee is a keyboard tab stop and pauses on focus-within.
  See the open SC 2.2.2 item under **Motion**.
- Touch targets are ≥44×44px. `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` stills the
  starfield and every transition — verified in test, not just declared.

## Responsive

No horizontal overflow at 320 · 360 · 390 · 430 · 640 · 768 · 834 · 900 · 1024
· 1280 · 1440 · 1920px.

On phones the hero's CTAs and both app-store badges go full width and stack,
and the story-cover type steps down (title 14px, category 10px) so it stays in
proportion to a ~167px card. Both revert from `sm` up.

## Known gaps before launch

- **App store badges are typeset, not official artwork.** Apple's and Google's
  badge lockups are trademarked and are not in the asset folder. Swap in the
  official assets before shipping. The Google Play badge is filled `#ffce4e`
  (`sun-400`) in the light contexts; both label lines take `ink-900`, because
  the muted grey lands at 3.89:1 on that yellow while ink clears 13.4:1. The
  badges on the purple CTA band keep the outline treatment.

- **`img-lulladream2` was never found.** The Safe-by-design section still uses
  the original stock photo — see the note under Known gaps.
- **Only one of the two requested photos exists.** `img-lulladream-1.avif` (in
  `~/Downloads`, note the hyphen and the `.avif` extension rather than the
  `img-lulladream1.webp` that was asked for) is now the narration image. There
  is no `img-lulladream2` anywhere on the machine, so the Safe-by-design
  section is unchanged and still uses stock.

- **The rest of the photography is a poor fit.** The supplied library is bright,
  daytime daycare stock. `NightPhoto` cools and dims it and washes it with the brand
  purple so it sits on the night surfaces, but the brief asks for a parent and
  child under blankets with a window behind — genuine low-light photography
  would replace both the treatment and the guesswork.
- **Story covers are real artwork** (`assets/AVIF/cover-1…4.avif`, 384×384)
  for Jack and the Beanstalk, Kraithong and the Crocodile King, Little Red
  Riding Hood and Phra Aphai Mani. They ship as **AVIF only** — supported in
  Chrome 85+, Firefox 93+ and Safari 16.4+. If the analytics show meaningful
  traffic on older Safari, add a `<picture>` with a WebP or JPEG fallback.
- **Ratings, quote counts and review text are illustrative.** Replace with real
  attributed reviews before publishing; fabricated social proof is a legal
  exposure, not just a copy placeholder.
- ~~The wordmark is set in type~~ — resolved: `assets/SVG/logo-lulladream.svg`
  is now used in the navbar and footer.
